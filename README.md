# Bridge Control Web Interface

A simple webpage that shows how an opening bridge can be controlled.  
It has buttons, sensor lights, and a small animation of the bridge and a boat.

## Features
- Buttons to **Open**, **Close**, **Stop**, and **Emergency Stop** the bridge.  
- Lights that show if the bridge is closed, open, or moving.  
- Sensors for boat, car, and pedestrian detection.  
- Animation of the bridge lifting and a boat passing through.  

## How to Use
1. Download or clone this project.  
2. Open `webInterface.html` in your browser.  
3. Use the buttons and watch the bridge move.  

## Notes
- This is just a **demo**.  
- The “Remote Connection” box is a placeholder for future Wi-Fi/WebSocket control.
